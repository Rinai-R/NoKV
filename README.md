## What Is NoKV?

NoKV is a metadata control plane for object-backed agent artifacts: run
outputs, log files, checkpoints, reports, and citable evidence in one
filesystem-shaped namespace. For the longer interface argument, see
[Agents Want Filesystems](https://nokv.io/blog/agents-want-filesystems).

It is not a trace database. Keep JSONL, SQLite, or Postgres as the source of
truth for runtime events; use NoKV as the agent-facing namespace over the
artifacts and evidence those systems produce.

NoKV keeps namespace metadata in its own path-native engine
([Holt](https://crates.io/crates/holt)) and stores file bodies as immutable
blocks in S3-compatible object storage such as RustFS, MinIO, Ceph RGW, or AWS
S3.

```text
FUSE / SDK / CLI
  -> NoKV metadata service     (self-contained; no separate metadata DB to run)
  -> Holt inode/dentry metadata
  -> S3-compatible object store for file bodies
```

NoKV owns namespace truth, metadata transactions, snapshots, watches, and
object-reference GC. The object store owns byte durability and replication. The
metadata engine is built in, so local deployments operate a filesystem rather
than a filesystem plus a separate Redis, MySQL, or TiKV cluster.

## Why NoKV

Agent workflows are artifact-heavy; their workspaces aren't. Every run leaves
behind configs, metrics, logs, checkpoints — and that state scatters across
folders, JSON files, object-store keys, and database rows. Agents pay a
navigation tax in tokens every time they go looking. NoKV gives that state one
address, with the metadata guarantees the workload actually needs:

- **Checkpoints publish atomically.** Readers see the complete new checkpoint
  or the previous one — never a half-written file, even across a crash.
- **Snapshots are time travel.** Pin a frozen view of any subtree and keep
  reading it while jobs write; GC never deletes what a snapshot still needs.
- **Changes are events, not polls.** Every create, rename, and publish lands as
  a typed, replayable event with a cursor.
- **Artifacts carry body references and digests**, with cleanup of failed
  staged uploads.
- **Bodies are immutable, versioned blocks.** Replacement publishes a new
  generation, so node-local caches never invalidate object bytes after publish.

The primary write model is write-once publish, matching how datasets,
checkpoints, and artifacts are commonly written.

## 🤖 The Agent Interface

`ls` · `stat` · `catalog` · `find` · `aggregate` · `read` · `grep`

Seven verbs, one progressive-disclosure surface: an agent discovers what
exists, learns what is queryable, and pays to read only what it needs.
Predicates, sort, and projection are pushed into the engine, so a "top-5 runs
by val_loss" report costs two calls — one `catalog`, one `find`. `grep` sweeps
a subtree and returns line-numbered matches with citable evidence URIs
(`nokv-native://path@generation:N#L3`).

The verbs live in [`nokv-agent`](crates/nokv-agent/src/lib.rs): the tool
definitions are LLM-ready JSON schemas, and `execute_agent_tool` routes calls
over the same `AgentNamespace` trait whether the namespace is embedded
(in-process) or remote (metadata RPC via `nokv-client`). The crate is
transport-free — it depends only on `nokv-meta`, `nokv-object`, and
`nokv-types`. See the [contributor handbook](docs/development/nokv-agent.md).

**Today** the agent verbs ship in the Rust SDK, the `nokv` CLI and FUSE
mount, and a native MCP server over stdio transport. Run `nokv mcp` to
serve the seven read-only agent tools to any MCP-capable client.

```bash
cargo run --release -p nokv --bin nokv -- mcp
```

To configure it in an MCP client (e.g. Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "nokv-mcp": {
    "command": "/path/to/NoKV/target/release/nokv",
    "args": ["mcp"]
  }
}
```

The same `--server-bind`, `--object-backend`, `--mount`, and control-plane
flags from the rest of the CLI apply, e.g.:

```bash
nokv --server-bind 127.0.0.1:7777 --object-backend rustfs mcp
```

**v1 constraints:** stdio transport only (no HTTP/SSE); read-only — the
seven existing agent tools only, no write or publish tools; no network
registration path for `register_namespace_index` (it remains
embedded-only — see the [contributor handbook](docs/development/nokv-agent.md)
section 6 for why).

## NoKV vs JuiceFS

NoKV follows the same high-level separation used by systems like JuiceFS and
3FS: metadata is separate from file body storage. The difference is that NoKV
ships its metadata engine as part of the filesystem and optimizes for
agent-workspace and artifact publish/read patterns first.

| | JuiceFS | NoKV |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metadata engine | External DB such as Redis, MySQL, or TiKV | Built-in, path-native Holt engine |
| Atomic checkpoint publish | POSIX rename/write semantics over the metadata engine | First-class publish-by-generation primitive |
| Block model | Slice/block model supporting broad POSIX behavior | Immutable object blocks plus new-generation manifests |
| Workspace-native primitives | Layered on top of the filesystem | Snapshots, typed watch, body descriptors, and GC floors are core metadata concepts |
| Agent query surface | None | `ls`/`stat`/`catalog`/`find`/`aggregate`/`read`/`grep` with push-down and line-numbered evidence |
| POSIX completeness | Mature production filesystem | P0 subset implemented; still hardening compatibility gates |
| Maturity | Production, large deployments | Young Rust implementation; single-node local mode is usable, replication is roadmap |

NoKV is an object-backed filesystem with a sharded Holt metadata plane: multiple
metadata shards (one Holt engine each) behind long-running metadata servers,
routed through an etcd control plane, with cross-shard grafts presenting a single
FUSE namespace across shards. Metadata HA today is single-writer-per-shard with
checkpoint-image + shared-log, epoch-fenced failover — not yet consensus
replication — so it is not yet a JuiceFS/3FS class production-HA distributed
filesystem.



## 🚦 Quick Start

Build and test:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo build --release -p nokv --bin nokv
```

Start a local RustFS-compatible S3 endpoint and create the default bucket:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/rustfs-data
RUSTFS_ACCESS_KEY=rustfsadmin \
RUSTFS_SECRET_KEY=rustfsadmin \
rustfs server --address 127.0.0.1:9000 /tmp/rustfs-data &

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=rustfsadmin \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=rustfsadmin \
aws --endpoint-url http://127.0.0.1:9000 \
  s3api create-bucket --bucket nokv
```

By default NoKV expects bucket `nokv` at `http://127.0.0.1:9000` with
development credentials `rustfsadmin` / `rustfsadmin`. See
[docs/rustfs.md](docs/rustfs.md) for other deployment modes.

Start the metadata server, then initialize the namespace. Every other command
talks to the server on `127.0.0.1:7777`, so keep it running:

```bash
cargo run --release -p nokv --bin nokv -- serve &

cargo run --release -p nokv --bin nokv -- init
```

Publish and read an artifact:

```bash
cargo run --release -p nokv --bin nokv -- \
  put-artifact /runs/1/checkpoint.bin ./checkpoint.bin

cargo run --release -p nokv --bin nokv -- \
  cat /runs/1/checkpoint.bin > restored.bin
```

Mount with FUSE:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/nokv-mount

cargo run --release -p nokv --bin nokv -- \
  mount /tmp/nokv-mount
```

On macOS this requires macFUSE. NoKV passes the `noappledouble` mount option to
avoid Finder/resource-fork AppleDouble sidecars; user xattr roundtrip is
covered by the FUSE smoke test.
